    "text": "Enrollment Types\nIn this section, we will explain how the file looks like in different enrollment types\n\nEnrollment Type: Initial Enrollment\nUse case: Enroll a new member/family\nInstructions: Typically, the Initial Enrollment transaction is the first transaction to be sent for a member. It is created after an applicant has been determined to be eligible and they have selected a Qualified Health Plan (QHP)\nWhen members enroll in a new policy or add a dependent to an existing policy, regardless of whether the member is new or existing, the vendor sends “ADDITION” as the change type for all new enrollees.\nExample Table 1. Initial Enrollment\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nmember1\nmember2\n\n\n\n\nplan.hios_id\n12345NY100001\n12345NY100001\n\n\nenrollment.external_policy_id\nplat_policy_ID_1\nplat_policy_ID_1\n\n\nenrollee.first_name\nJoe\nJane\n\n\nenrollee.ethnicity\n2135-1\n2135-1\n\n\nenrollee.relationship_to_policy_holder\n18 (subscriber)\n01 (spouse)\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_start_date\n2025-03-01\n2025-03-01\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_end_date\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\nenrollee.mailing_address.address_line_1\n123 first st\n123 first st\n\n\nenrollee.change_type\nADDITION\nADDITION\n\n\nenrollee.change_effective_date\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\nenrollee.addtional_maintenance_reason\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment Type: Change Enrollment\nWhen any active member needs to change information including demographic information, plan, mailing address, residential address, coverage start date, platforms can send an enrollment with change type of CHANGE for the member that contains any change. Platforms should not use enrollment with change type of CHANGE to send coverage end date change, that must be sent with change type as CANCELLATION/TERMINATION.\nUnless otherwise specified, all the following change cases are assumed to occur after the initial enrollment. To minimize misunderstandings between removing and changing data, the platform should continue to send all data for fields that have not been altered.\n\nChange Type: Demographic Change\nUse case: Edit demographic information for an existing member Instructions: The platform sends Oscar a CHANGE enrollment. In the enrollment, the platform needs to include all the members’ information under the policy. If there is any change for a member, use change type of CHANGE for this member, otherwise, please use NO_OP.\nIn the example below, the subscriber changed their ethnicity, but there is no change for the dependent. In this case, subscriber’s change type would be CHANGE since there are changes involved, and dependents’s change type would be NO_OP since no change is made and no operation is required.\nExample Subscriber found that their demographic information (In this example, the ethnicity) is incorrect and needs to be updated.\nTable 2. Demographic change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nmember1\nmember2\n\n\n\n\nenrollment.external_policy_id\nplat_policy_ID_1\nplat_policy_ID_1\n\n\nenrollee.first_name\nJoe\nJane\n\n\nenrollee.ethnicity\n2135-2\n2135-1\n\n\nenrollee.relationship_to_policy_holder\n18 (subscriber)\n01 (spouse)\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_start_date\n2025-03-01\n2025-03-01\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_end_date\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\nenrollee.mailing_address.address_line_1\n123 first st\n123 first st\n\n\nenrollee.change_type\nCHANGE\nNO_OP\n\n\nenrollee.change_effective_date\n2025-03-01\n(leave blank)\n\n\nenrollee.addtional_maintenance_reason\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Type: Policy Change\nUse Case: Switch policy for an existing member\nInstructions: The platform will utilize a CHANGE enrollment transaction when a member switches policies mid-year due to a qualifying life event.\nExample\nIn this case, the members are changing their plan effective 2025-05-01, meaning the change will take effect on 2025-05-01.\nTable 3.

Address change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nmember1\nmember2\n\n\n\n\nplan.hios_id\n12345NY100022\n12345NY100022\n\n\nenrollment.external_policy_id\nplat_policy_ID_1\nplat_policy_ID_1\n\n\nenrollee.first_name\nJoe\nJane\n\n\nenrollee.relationship_to_policy_holder\n18 (subscriber)\n01 (spouse)\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_start_date\n2025-03-01\n2025-03-01\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_end_date\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\nenrollee.mailing_address.address_line_1\n123 first st\n123 first st\n\n\nenrollee.change_type\nCHANGE\nCHANGE\n\n\nenrollee.change_effective_date\n2025-05-01\n2025-05-01\n\n\nenrollee.addtional_maintenance_reason\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Type: Add Dependent\nUse Case: Add a new dependent to an existing subscriber’s policy\nInstructions: use CHANGE change_type for the subscriber and ADDITION for the new dependent. Platforms should send all information for the covered members whether or not there is a change for those members. If there is a change for a member, use change type of CHANGE for this member; otherwise, use NO_OP.\nExample\nTable 5. Add dependent change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nmember1\nmember2\nmember3\n\n\n\n\nenrollment.external_policy_id\nplat_policy_ID_1\nplat_policy_ID_1\nplat_policy_ID_1\n\n\nenrollee.first_name\nJoe\nJane\nJack\n\n\nenrollee.relationship_to_policy_holder\n18 (subscriber)\n01 (spouse)\n19 (child)\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_start_date\n2025-03-01\n2025-03-01\n2025-05-01\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_end_date\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\nenrollee.mailing_address.address_line_1\n123 first st\n123 first st\n123 first st\n\n\nenrollee.change_type\nCHANGE\nNO_OP\nADDITION\n\n\nenrollee.addtional_maintenance_reason\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Type: Remove Dependent\nUse Case: To remove a dependent from an existing policy\nInstructions: use the change_type CANCELLATION or TERMINATION. If the coverage end date is equal to coverage start date, it will be categorized as CANCELLATION; otherwise, use TERMINATION. The platform needs to send the information for all covered members, regardless of whether there is any change for these members. If there is any change for a member, use change type of CHANGE for this member; otherwise, use NO_OP.\nSince the financial amount for the subscriber will change if members want to remove the dependent, the change type of subscriber should be CHANGE.\nExample:\nTable 6. Remove dependent change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nmember1\nmember2\n\n\n\n\nenrollment.external_policy_id\nplat_policy_ID_1\nplat_policy_ID_1\n\n\nenrollee.first_name\nJoe\nJane\n\n\nenrollee.relationship_to_policy_holder\n18 (subscriber)\n01 (spouse)\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_start_date\n2025-03-01\n2025-03-01\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_end_date\n(leave blank)\n2025-03-01\n\n\nenrollee.mailing_address.address_line_1\n123 first st\n123 first st\n\n\nenrollee.change_type\nCHANGE\nCANCELLATION\n\n\nenrollee.addtional_maintenance_reason\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Type: Leave platform\nUse case: If an employer decides to switch ICHRA platform administrators or an employee loses their ICHRA benefits (e.g. through loss of a job), they still may retain their carrier’s ACA IFP coverage as a non-ICHRA member and pay for their coverage out of pocket.\nFor administrator platforms, this is especially important to implement to avoid having premium payments withdrawn or failed autopay runs for employees and employers who are no longer using your platform.\nInstructions: To let the carrier know when a member is no longer enrolled through the administrator platform but has not terminated their coverage, the administrator will send a CHANGE type enrollment transaction with maintenance reason code LEAVE_PLATFORM on an inbound enrollment transaction.\nExample:\nTable 7. Leave platform change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nmember1\nmember2\n\n\n\n\nenrollment.external_policy_id\nplat_policy_ID_1\nplat_policy_ID_1\n\n\nenrollee.first_name\nJoe\nJane\n\n\nenrollee.relationship_to_policy_holder\n18 (subscriber)\n01 (spouse)\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_start_date\n2025-03-01\n2025-03-01\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_end_date\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\nenrollee.mailing_address.address_line_1\n123 first st\n123 first st\n\n\nenrollee.change_type\nCHANGE\nCHANGE\n\n\nenrollee.change_effective_date\n2025-08-15\n2025-08-15\n\n\nenrollee.addtional_maintenance_reason\nLEAVE_PLATFORM\nLEAVE_PLATFORM\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment Type: Cancellation/Termination\n\nCancellation (“Cancel”)\nUse Case: Terminate a policy before coverage has begun (i.e. coverage start date is in the future) Instructions: A cancellation will result in coverage being cancelled for all members on the policy, but only the subscriber’s information needs to be sent. To cancel a member’s policy, the change type for the subscriber must be set to CANCELLATION.\nPlease note that the coverage end date will be the same as the coverage start date for cancellation.\nExample:\nTable 8. Cancellations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nmember1\n\n\n\n\nenrollment.external_policy_id\nplat_policy_ID_1\n\n\nenrollee.first_name\nJoe\n\n\nenrollee.relationship_to_policy_holder\n18 (subscriber)\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_start_date\n2025-03-01\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_end_date\n2025-03-01\n\n\nenrollee.mailing_address.address_line_1\n123 first st\n\n\nenrollee.change_type\nCANCELLATION\n\n\nenrollee.addtional_maintenance_reason\n(leave blank)\n\n\n…\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTermination (“Terminate”)\nUse Case: Terminate a policy after coverage has begun (i.e. coverage end date is after coverage start date) Instructions: To terminate a member’s policy, the change type for the subscriber must be set to TERMINATION. The platform only needs to send the subscriber’s information.\nPlease note that the coverage end date will not be the same as the coverage start date for termination.\nExample:\nTable 9. Terminations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nmember1\n\n\n\n\nenrollment.external_policy_id\nplat_policy_ID_1\n\n\nenrollee.first_name\nJoe\n\n\nenrollee.relationship_to_policy_holder\n18 (subscriber)\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_start_date\n2025-03-01\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_end_date\n2025-10-15\n\n\nenrollee.mailing_address.address_line_1\n123 first st\n\n\nenrollee.change_type\nTERMINATION\n\n\nenrollee.addtional_maintenance_reason\n(leave blank)\n\n\n…\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment Transaction Type: Reinstatement\nUse case: recover a cancelled/terminated policy with the original policy information and coverage start date.\nInstructions:\nThe change type for the subscriber must be set to REINSTATEMENT, and a transaction must be sent for all members on the policy who should be reinstated\nIf the members update their information during the reinstatement procedure, the platform needs to send another change enrollment to include the updated information.\nExample:\nTable 10. Reinstatements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nmember1\nmember2\n\n\n\n\nenrollment.external_policy_id\nplat_policy_ID_1\nplat_policy_ID_1\n\n\nenrollee.first_name\nJoe\nJane\n\n\nenrollee.relationship_to_policy_holder\n18 (subscriber)\n01 (spouse)\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_start_date\n2025-03-01\n2025-03-01\n\n\nenrollee.coverage_end_date\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)\n\n\nenrollee.mailing_address.address_line_1\n123 first st\n123 first st\n\n\nenrollee.change_type\nREINSTATEMENT\nREINSTATEMENT\n\n\nenrollee.addtional_maintenance_reason\n(leave blank)\n(leave blank)",

    "section": "FAQs",
    "text": "FAQs\n\nWhat types of integrations does Oscar support for ICHRA administrators?\nFor off-exchange ICHRA enrollments, Oscar currently supports two main methods of integration for enrollment and payment data:\n\nDual-file EDI Integration\n\nEnrollment: Daily batch 834 EDI - inbound and outbound\n\nTA1/999 Acknowledgement & Error response\n\nCSV Reconciliation\n\n\nPayment: Batch 820 EDI for payment remittance with ACH direct deposit\nFor both the enrollment 834 EDI and 820 EDI implementation, we use the CMS implementation standards, with a modification to the 834 EDI standard to include employer information in the 2100D employer loop.\n\nCombined File CSV Integration\n\nSingle combined enrollment & payment CSV file - daily batch (Oscar Inbound)\n\nPayment instrument details (bank account information) is passed to Oscar with the enrollment data and binder payments and auto-payments are automatically enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\nOscar CSV Acknowledgement file - daily (Oscar Outbound)\n\nOscar CSV Enrollment Status file (Oscar Outbound)\n\n\nBoth implementations include error handling and both automated and manual reconciliation flows managed by our operations teams.\n\n\nCan I request changes to the integration specification?\nYes. We are open to making changes to the integration specification to support your requirements. Reach out to us to discuss further.\n\n\nDoes Oscar have a REST API I can use?\nWe plan on launching an external enrollment or payment REST API for administrators and carriers to leverage soon!\n\n\nWhat is the typical timeline for integration?\nOscar works with each ICHRA administrator directly to identify their unique integration needs. This process can vary depending on the complexity of your system and the method of integration chosen. On average, it can take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months.\n\n\nDoes Oscar accept credit or debit card information in the CSV enrollment file?\nOscar accepts ACH (Automated Clearinghouse) bank account numbers in the combined CSV enrollment and payment files.\n\n\nHow can I integrate my ICHRA administrator platform with Oscar?\nThanks for your interest in ICHRA at Oscar! Please reach out to ichra@hioscar.com to set up an integration or ask any other questions about ICHRA Connect.",

    "text": "ICHRA at Oscar\nAt Oscar, our mission is to make a healthier life accessible and affordable for all. We believe that a larger individual market is the best solution for Americans and view ICHRA (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement) as the future of health benefits. Just like the 401k revolutionized retirement planning, ICHRA is poised to transform health benefits by putting the individual in control, while also giving employers reduced and predictable healthcare costs. Demand and awareness are growing, and Oscar is paving the way for the future of ICHRA.\n\n\nWhy ICHRA?\nICHRA is a great option for both employers and employees, providing:\n\nFlexibility: Employers can tailor contributions to different classes of employees, providing a customizable approach to health benefits.\nAffordability: Employers have predictable costs by setting defined contribution amounts, avoiding the unpredictability of traditional group health insurance premiums.\nChoice: Employees can choose individual health plans that best meet their schedules, locations, and health needs, enhancing satisfaction and coverage suitability.\nPortability: Employees can keep their plan design, mid-year accumulations towards deductibles, and provider network, if and when they leave their employer.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is ICHRA Connect?\nICHRA Connect is an open source, universal, company-agnostic integration specification designed to reduce friction, encourage faster growth of the ICHRA market, and allow ICHRA administrators to integrate seamlessly with carriers. Oscar’s goal is to prove the viability of administrator-to-carrier interoperability and set a standard for a functioning ICHRA marketplace.\nICHRA Connect will streamline shopping, enrollment, billing, and other operational workflows to offer an ICHRA experience that rivals or surpasses traditional group plans. ICHRA Connect will standardize data reconciliation and eligibility updates, bringing ICHRA on par with group and on-exchange ACA experiences. Additionally, Oscar intends to establish shared data integration standards to enhance collaboration among ICHRA stakeholders and foster a more efficient market.\n\n\nOur Singular Focus\nWith ICHRA Connect, Oscar aims to create a shared technical infrastructure that enables carriers and administrators to work together to scale the ICHRA market.\n\n\nHow We’re Doing It\nOscar is developing an open integration specification to streamline ICHRA workflows, including:\n\nShopping & Enrollment\nEligibility\nBilling & Payment\nOther operational workflows necessary to offer an ICHRA experience that is on par or better than the group plan experience\n\nOscar understands that the landscape of health benefits, especially ICHRA, is constantly evolving. To stay ahead of these changes:\n\nOscar is developing specifications in collaboration with ICHRA administrators and other carriers through working groups.\nOscar’s standards will explicitly ensure that member data is easily reconcilable and that member eligibility status is as accurate as possible between vendors and carriers.\nOscar’s integration standards will continuously evolve to meet new challenges and opportunities.\nOscar plans to develop a RESTful API standard that will further streamline integrations, enhance interoperability, and provide a more seamless experience for all stakeholders involved in the ICHRA ecosystem.\n\n\n\nOpen Source\nThe ICHRA Connect integration specification is open source and licensed under a commercially permissive Apache 2.0 License. We welcome you to use the ICHRA Connect specification to power your data integration. You can also contribute bugs, feature, and improvements by joining our working group or filing an Issue in our Github repo. The source code for this website and the specifications can be found at github.com/oscarhealth/IchraConnect\n\n\nHow to Integrate with Oscar\nIf you’re interested in setting up an ICHRA integration with Oscar, please reach out to ichra@hioscar.com for more information or see our high-level overview and technical specifications for ICHRA integrations.\n\n\n\nAdopt the ICHRA Connect Specification\n\n\nIf you are a carrier interested in modifying or adopting the ICHRA Connect integration specifications, please reach out to join our working groups.\n\nContact Us",
