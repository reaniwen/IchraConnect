    "text": "ICHRA at Oscar\nAt Oscar, our mission is to make a healthier life accessible and affordable for all. We believe that a larger individual market is the best solution for Americans and view ICHRA (Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement) as the future of health benefits. Just like the 401k revolutionized retirement planning, ICHRA is poised to transform health benefits by putting the individual in control, while also giving employers reduced and predictable healthcare costs. Demand and awareness are growing, and Oscar is paving the way for the future of ICHRA.\n\n\nWhy ICHRA?\nICHRA is a great option for both employers and employees, providing:\n\nFlexibility: Employers can tailor contributions to different classes of employees, providing a customizable approach to health benefits.\nAffordability: Employers have predictable costs by setting defined contribution amounts, avoiding the unpredictability of traditional group health insurance premiums.\nChoice: Employees can choose individual health plans that best meet their schedules, locations, and health needs, enhancing satisfaction and coverage suitability.\nPortability: Employees can keep their plan design, mid-year accumulations towards deductibles, and provider network, if and when they leave their employer.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is ICHRA Connect?\nICHRA Connect is an open source, universal, company-agnostic integration specification designed to reduce friction, encourage faster growth of the ICHRA market, and allow ICHRA administrators to integrate seamlessly with carriers. Oscar’s goal is to prove the viability of administrator-to-carrier interoperability and set a standard for a functioning ICHRA marketplace.\nICHRA Connect will streamline shopping, enrollment, billing, and other operational workflows to offer an ICHRA experience that rivals or surpasses traditional group plans. ICHRA Connect will standardize data reconciliation and eligibility updates, bringing ICHRA on par with group and on-exchange ACA experiences. Additionally, Oscar intends to establish shared data integration standards to enhance collaboration among ICHRA stakeholders and foster a more efficient market.\n\n\nOur Singular Focus\nWith ICHRA Connect, Oscar aims to create a shared technical infrastructure that enables carriers and administrators to work together to scale the ICHRA market.\n\n\nHow We’re Doing It\nOscar is developing an open integration specification to streamline ICHRA workflows, including:\n\nShopping & Enrollment\nEligibility\nBilling & Payment\nOther operational workflows necessary to offer an ICHRA experience that is on par or better than the group plan experience\n\nOscar understands that the landscape of health benefits, especially ICHRA, is constantly evolving. To stay ahead of these changes:\n\nOscar is developing specifications in collaboration with ICHRA administrators and other carriers through working groups.\nOscar’s standards will explicitly ensure that member data is easily reconcilable and that member eligibility status is as accurate as possible between vendors and carriers.\nOscar’s integration standards will continuously evolve to meet new challenges and opportunities.\nOscar plans to develop a RESTful API standard that will further streamline integrations, enhance interoperability, and provide a more seamless experience for all stakeholders involved in the ICHRA ecosystem.\n\n\n\nOpen Source\nThe ICHRA Connect integration specification is open source and licensed under a commercially permissive Apache 2.0 License. We welcome you to use the ICHRA Connect specification to power your data integration. You can also contribute bugs, feature, and improvements by joining our working group or filing an Issue in our Github repo. The source code for this website and the specifications can be found at github.com/oscarhealth/IchraConnect\n\n\nHow to Integrate with Oscar\nIf you’re interested in setting up an ICHRA integration with Oscar, please reach out to ichra@hioscar.com for more information or see our high-level overview and technical specifications for ICHRA integrations.\n\n\n\nAdopt the ICHRA Connect Specification\n\n\nIf you are a carrier interested in modifying or adopting the ICHRA Connect integration specifications, please reach out to join our working groups.\n\nContact Us",

We are open to making changes to the integration specification to support your requirements. Reach out to us to discuss further.\n\n\nDoes Oscar have a REST API I can use?\nWe plan on launching an external enrollment or payment REST API for administrators and carriers to leverage soon!\n\n\nWhat is the typical timeline for integration?\nOscar works with each ICHRA administrator directly to identify their unique integration needs. This process can vary depending on the complexity of your system and the method of integration chosen. On average, it can take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months.\n\n\nDoes Oscar accept credit or debit card information in the CSV enrollment file?\nOscar accepts ACH (Automated Clearinghouse) bank account numbers in the combined CSV enrollment and payment files.\n\n\nHow can I integrate my ICHRA administrator platform with Oscar?\nThanks for your interest in ICHRA at Oscar! Please reach out to ichra@hioscar.com to set up an integration or ask any other questions about ICHRA Connect.",

Carrier ingests and enrolls members from this file as they would with a standard enrollment integration.\nPayment information sent in this file includes one Automated Clearing House (ACH) account number per member (payment instrument). We do not accept credit card or debit card numbers as payment instruments.\nAt the time of enrollment, carrier enables Autopay for each enrolled member, withdraws members’ initial binder payments, and effectuates them. Members must affirmatively confirm that the employer will be making payments on their behalf as part of the administrator enrollment flow.\nAfter autopay is enabled, carrier will automatically draft:\n\nBinder payments: before state regulatory deadlines, which may be as early as the enrollment date.\nFull outstanding balance: members may be drafted one or more times per month to ensure balance is paid by the premium due date. Exact auto-draft dates will be selected by carrier and the administrator.\n\n\nICHRA Group / Employer Information\nAdministrator will pass Employer Name and Employer TIN on the inbound enrollment files.\n\n\nICHRA Administrator Disenrollments (“Soft terms”)\nIf an employer decides to switch ICHRA platform administrators or an employee loses their ICHRA benefits (e.g. through loss of a job), they still may retain their carrier’s ACA IFP coverage as a non-ICHRA member and pay for their coverage out of pocket.\nTo let the carrier know when a member is no longer enrolled through the administrator platform but has not terminated their coverage, the administrator will send a CHANGE type enrollment transaction with maintenance reason code LEAVE_PLATFORM on an inbound enrollment transaction.\n\n\nRefunds\nEligibility changes resulting in premium changes, negative or positive, will be handled as usual for IFP members: adjustments will be made to future amounts owed, and if not sufficient, carrier will be able to facilitate refunds directly to members.\n\n\nReconciliation\nWe use a weekly reconciliation file to ensure eligibility and billing data is aligned between carrier and the administrator in order to avoid disruptions to member coverage or experiences; for example, a mid-month increase to members’ premiums that could result in declined transactions at time of auto-pay.\nThe reconciliation file is a full change file that contains a snapshot of all plan year YTD membership, including cancelled and termed members, plus a 3 month prior-year lookback.\nEach enrolled member will have one record per month enrolled with the corresponding monthly premium amount for that month.\n\n\n\nFile Details\n\nInbound Enrollment File\n\nDirection: Carrier inbound/administrator outbound\nFile type: CSV\nFile spec: Inbound Enrollment Spec\nCadence: Daily\nNaming convention: FROM_ADMIN_NAME.EMT.YYYYMMDDThhmmss.P.csv\nDelta file or full file: Delta\nFile transfer type: SFTP\nSample file: here\n\n\n\nOutbound Enrollment Ack File\n\nDirection: Carrier outbound/administrator inbound\nFile type: CSV\nFile spec: Outbound Enrollment Ack File Spec\nCadence: Daily\nNaming convention: TO_ADMIN_NAME.ACK.YYYYMMDDThhmmss.P.csv\nSample file: here\n\n\n\nOutbound Enrollment File\n\nFile type: CSV\nFile spec: Outbound Enrollment File\nCadence: Daily\nNaming convention: FROM_CARRIER.OUT.YYYYMMDDThhmmss.P.csv\nDelta file or full file: Delta\nSample file: here\n\n\n\nOutbound Reconciliation File\n\nFile type: CSV\nFile spec: Outbound Reconciliation File\nCadence: Weekly\nFull or Delta: Full snapshot of plan year, with 3 month look back to previous year\nNaming Convention: FROM_CARRIER_SNAPSHOT.OUT.YYYYMMDDThhmmss.P.csv\nSample file: here",
