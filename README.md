# ICHRA Connect

ICHRA Connect is an open source, universal, company-agnostic integration specification designed to reduce friction, encourage faster growth of the ICHRA market, and allow ICHRA administrators to integrate seamlessly with carriers. Oscarâ€™s goal is to prove the viability of administrator-to-carrier interoperability and set a standard for a functioning ICHRA marketplace.

ICHRA Connect will streamline shopping, enrollment, billing, and other operational workflows to offer an ICHRA experience that rivals or surpasses traditional group plans. ICHRA Connect will standardize data reconciliation and eligibility updates, bringing ICHRA on par with group and on-exchange ACA experiences. Additionally, Oscar intends to establish shared data integration standards to enhance collaboration among ICHRA stakeholders and foster a more efficient market.
